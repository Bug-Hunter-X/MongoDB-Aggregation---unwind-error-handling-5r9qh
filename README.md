# MongoDB Aggregation $unwind Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` operator in MongoDB aggregations, specifically when dealing with arrays that might be empty. The `$unwind` operator is used to deconstruct an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element.  However, if the array is empty, it will throw an error and halt the entire aggregation pipeline. 

The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` illustrates how to properly handle this using the `$ifNull` operator or a conditional aggregation stage.  This prevents unexpected behavior and allows your aggregation to process documents even when a specific array field is absent or empty.
